## The Staff

### Reception
**Name:** Erik Lindqvist
**Description:** Perpetually stressed 28-year-old with man bun and sleeve tattoos. Working hostel jobs across Europe for five years. High turnover means he's the most experienced staff member despite being there only 8 months.
**Role in death:** Oblivious - too busy with check-in chaos to notice Helena enter luggage room

### Other Staff
| Role | Name | Notable Trait |
|------|------|---------------|
| Cleaner | Agnieszka | Polish immigrant; warned about luggage room lock months ago |
| Security | None | Budget cuts eliminated night security |
| Bar/Kitchen | Marcus & Linnea | Young Swedish couple focused only on rooftop bar |
| Manager | Stefan Moreau | Absentee owner; appears only to count receipts |

### Staff Knowledge
They know the luggage room door is faulty. Agnieszka has filed three maintenance requests. Stefan won't pay for repairs. After the death, all requests mysteriously "cannot be found."

## Hostel Atmosphere

### Day Vibe
Hungover recovery. People shuffling to kitchen in pajamas. Sounds of retching from bathrooms. Serious travelers planning itineraries in common room.

### Night Vibe
Pre-game central. Rooftop bar packed. Groups forming for club outings. Noise complaints ignored. During festival weekend: absolute chaos from 6 PM onward.

### Guest Demographics
Mix of young Europeans on Interrail passes, American gap-year students, older budget travelers priced out of hotels, and long-term digital nomads in private rooms.

### Reputation
TripAdvisor: 3.8 stars - "Great location, party atmosphere, can be too loud, basic facilities"
HostelWorld: "Fun but chaotic" - common complaint about lost luggage and disorganization

## Practical Details

### Getting There
Arlanda Express to Central Station, then metro to Odenplan, 10-minute walk through residential area.

### Check-in Process
Theoretically 3 PM, but festival weekend means 24/7 arrivals. ID scan, quick room assignment, pointed toward luggage room "help yourself."

### Rules
- Quiet hours 11 PM-8 AM (unenforced)
- No guests in dorms (ignored)
- Luggage room at own risk (the relevant one)
- No food in rooms (bugs are a problem)

### Amenities
- [x] Wi-Fi (quality: mediocre - 200 people sharing)
- [x] Kitchen
- [x] Lockers (in rooms only)
- [x] Laundry (one machine, always broken)
- [ ] Pool
- [x] Bar
- [x] Rooftop
- [x] Tours offered (pub crawls)
- [x] Other: Bike rental, airport shuttle signup

## Real-World Research

### Accuracy Notes
Stockholm's hostel scene is genuinely robust. Many converted warehouses exist in formerly industrial areas. Festival season (August) does see massive overflow. Swedish privacy culture means less intervention in others' business.

### Cultural Sensitivity
- Avoid stereotyping Swedish people as cold; frame as "respecting privacy"
- Stockholm is extremely safe; the horror is in the exception
- Reference real areas but use fictional hostel name

### Sources
- Stockholm tourist board information
- Hostelworld reviews of Stockholm hostels
- Swedish workplace safety regulations (for luggage room violations)
- News reports of storage-related asphyxiation deaths
