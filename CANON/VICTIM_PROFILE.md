## Archetype
**Primary:** Type-A Planner

**Secondary traits:** Control freak, anxiety-masker, former corporate burnout

## The Fatal Flaw
**Core Flaw:** Control

**How it manifests:**
- Color-codes her packing cubes and maintains spreadsheets for every trip
- Cannot relax until everything is in its "proper place"
- Insists on personally supervising the storage of her bags

**How it kills them:**
Her compulsive need to reorganize the chaotic luggage room leads her to venture deep inside during peak check-in chaos, where she becomes trapped when new bags are thrown in and the door closes.

- **Typical outfit:** Linen pants, breathable button-down, sensible walking shoes (all matching, all wrinkle-resistant)

## Personality

### Positive Traits (that get twisted)
1. Organized - becomes an obsessive need to control every detail
2. Helpful - becomes condescending as she "fixes" others' messes

### Negative Traits (that seal their fate)
1. Cannot delegate - leads to her going into the luggage room herself
2. Dismisses others' warnings as "disorganized thinking" - ignores staff telling her to stay out

### Pet Peeves
- Messy common areas (ironic: dies in the messiest room)
- People who "pack wrong"

### Fears
- Surface fear: Losing her luggage
- Deeper fear: Losing control of her carefully constructed life

## Background

### Origin Story
Grew up in a chaotic household in Malmo with hoarder parents. Became obsessed with organization as a coping mechanism. Built a successful career helping wealthy Stockholm clients declutter their lives, then burned out and decided to "find herself" through travel - but brought all her controlling tendencies with her.

### Why They Travel
Trying to prove she can be "spontaneous" while secretly pre-planning every moment. Running from the realization that organizing other people's lives was easier than dealing with her own emptiness.

### How They Ended Up at This Hostel
Selected it based on TripAdvisor reviews mentioning "clean and organized." Arrived during a festival weekend when it was anything but.

## Voice & Speech

### Vocabulary
- Uses words like: "systematic," "optimize," "designated space," "streamline"
- Avoids words like: "whatever," "wing it," "messy but fine"
- Catchphrases: "There's a system for everything" / "Let me help you with that"

### Speech Pattern
- Precise, clipped sentences
- Lists things in threes
- Corrects others' grammar

### Internal Monologue Style
Constant assessment and judgment. Mental checklists running at all times. Anxiety disguised as productivity.

## Digital Presence

### Social Media
- **Platform of choice:** Instagram
- **Follower count:** 47,000
- **Posting style:** Flat-lay photos of perfectly packed suitcases, "travel organization tips"
- **Last post before death:** A photo of her labeled packing cubes with caption "Day 47 of 90: Still living out of one carry-on"

### Online vs Reality
Presents serene minimalist efficiency. Reality: crippling anxiety if one sock is in the wrong cube.

## Relationships

### Family
- Estranged from hoarder parents; sends them Marie Kondo books they never open

### Friends
- Has "organization community" followers, not real friends

### Romantic
- Recently divorced; ex-husband cited her "inability to let anything be imperfect"

### At the Hostel
- Immediately tries to reorganize the common kitchen, annoying everyone
- Makes one friend: a young backpacker impressed by her packing system

## The Day They Die

### Morning
Wakes at 6 AM as always. Packs her bag with military precision. Discovers the luggage storage room is a disaster due to festival overflow.

### Their Last Normal Moment
Standing outside the luggage room, checking her color-coded departure schedule, thinking "I have 45 minutes - I can fix this."

### Final Thoughts
"I should have just... left it. Why couldn't I just leave it?"

### Last Words
"PLEASE! I'M IN HERE! SOMEONE! THE BAGS - I CAN'T - PLEASE!" (muffled, unheard)
